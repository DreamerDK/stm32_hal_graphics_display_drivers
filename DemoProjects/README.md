    This demo presents the LCD driver. Freertos is used. Another task is also running, which can be used to measure the current CPU usage for various drawing operations.
    Connect the input of a TTL-level USB/serial converter to the PA9 pin, set it to 115200bit/sec, and you can view the results in a terminal.
    If you don't have such a board, transfer the project to your own board.
